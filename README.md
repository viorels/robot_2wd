# 2WD Robot

This is the code for a simple two-wheel drive robot built with Arduino UNO, 2x DC motors, L298N driver and a HC-SR04 sonar

## Installing

Just install Arduino, clone the repository, copy robot\_pins.h.SAMPLE to robot\_pins.h and adjust for your configuration

## Future improvements

* connect and use driver PWM pins for smoother motion
* install optical encoder sensor for precise turns and measuring travel distance
* make it bring a beer
* implement enough AI for it to get his own beer when thirsty

Feel free to fork and add your own improvements...
